I prefer to write verbose code and don't shy away from using long self-explanatory variable names. Unless it's an experimental R&D project. Then I'd use x, y z until I am certain the program even works. I promise I don't like leaving code unattended.

Overtime, I have learned to appreciate elegant and concise code, expecially recursive ones.
