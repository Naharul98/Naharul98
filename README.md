I prefer to write verbose code. Don't get me wrong, I do appreciate elegant and concise code, however, I like to break down a problem and solve it in small chunks, which often results in verbose code.

I don't shy away from using long self-explanatory variable names. Unless it's an experimental R&D project. Then I'd use x and y until I am certain the program even works. 

I promise I don't like leaving code unattended! :blush:
